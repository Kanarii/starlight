Trivia Von is an enigma of a character. Our first encounter caused quite the stir, not only in our household, but in the entire city. He had caused property damage on a wide scale. Von is hard to trust as he's manipulative, his appearance and personality make him charming; He uses this aspect of himself to his advantage, coaxing sympathy from people and getting away with a minor scolding for committing crimes. He knows he is hard to hate. His intoxicating personality has no effect on me. Title

People describe me as chaotic, doing whatever I think of in the moment without fearing the repercussions-- Yeah that's pretty true.
[flips through the papers] "This has landed her in precarious situations with a lot of the other household members, especially those she's closest to."
Ah- yeah
Yuki, I will take reign of this description once more. This is my duty.
Her voice sounds synthesized and is a higher pitch than most other residents.
HEH, EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME COMING!
They can.
She is a Nekomata, a feline yokai from Japanese folklore.Picked up by Luna one day while out scavenging, Yuki arrived at the household as an amnesiac with no idea of who she was. Together we began to uncover her identity, coming to the conclusion that she is a physical manifestation of a video game character. This discovery is what led to our exploration of such a phenomenon. But with that, came chaos. Yuki has the ability to pull out characters from video games, as well as traverse the cyberspace via monitors and digital devices. This amount of power is far too dangerous for the likes of someone who lacks control over their urges. Thus, Yuki has pulled out multiple people, all of whom now live together with us as residents of the household.Yuki is the first virtual character that Luna met and the first resident of the house.Yuki finds it difficult to be direct with her feelings and often times switches between attitudes on a flip of a coin. It's hard to tell what her status is due to this. So a lot of people judge her based solely on her tone or mannerisms. Applying logic is difficult when you are talking to Yuki. Title

Trivia I am Luna's guardian.
Before she could walk, I watched over her as an assistant droid she created. Our relationship has grown ever-more distant as time passed.
My voice has been described as heavily processed and monotonous. I have been told that I sound very serious. Though deep inside, I believe I am quite compassionate. I have a strong conscience, valuing plant-life equally to human-life because of my existence. I have amassed a large garden, loving both flowers and plants alike. Though, upon peering deeper within myself, I realised there's more to this.
Something did not seem right. Title

Patented technology she created is used throughout Aurora.
Despite her aptitude for building robots, she does not share the same talent in programming.
I assist her.She grew up with a lot of the games that the other residents came from. Living alone for so long is what drove her to stay within her room. Her artificial companions were all she had to accompany her. As time passed, she gradually came out of her bedroom on a more frequent basis, albeit still not entirely conversational. I have calculated that this occurred because of the efforts of the other residents.
Her room is still her favourite place to be. Much to my dismay.
She can't take part in laborious activities because she has always been frail. Even bending down and standing up is difficult for her. As a result, she disfavours moving around.Luna is cynical, depressive and anti-social. She prefers to stay away from people, always having to hold her tongue to stop herself from being needlessly rude. This is due to her unhealthy relationship with adults and lack of socialisation with children her age. Labelled as 'mature' for her age, she's arrogant and cocky when conversing with anyone she judges as dumb. She's quick to turn on people, brushing them off while loudly berating them if they dare question her decisions. She absolutely refuses to let anyone get close to her, keeping up this airy fa√ßade of being above relationships with people. Despite this, she still has a childish side to her she tends to hide from people; Tinkering with robots, imagining up little personalities for each one. Artificial beings are the only exception to her cold-attitude. <br>Later on [<a href=".?query=tag:wip" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#wip">#wip</a>]Luna has light ginger hair with pale skin and freckles.
Scavenging Wear: Rugged green coat, thick pants and boots. Robot helmet to protect her identity.
Casual Wear: Orange jacket. Her under layers are a black long-sleeved shirt and vest. Long baggy pants. Usually blue. She always carries around a cellular device on her wrist. Luna has been blind since birth, relying on technology to live a semi-normal life. She grew attached to electronics.<br>
<a class="internal-link" data-href="../Kayde Lightfield.md" href="character-database/kayde-lightfield.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Lightfield</a> invented the cybernetics used for her eyes.
Her vision is limited to simple lines. This is due to how her brain comprehends the electrical currents delivered via the sensors installed within her eyes. People appear as bright outlines with limited facial features.
„Ö§
Her cybernetic eyes, while providing her with the ability to see, cannot perceive highly shiny surfaces.
Her eyes simply cannot comprehend such objects. It interferes with her eyesight, and she has spoken about experiencing migraines and headaches from prolonged exposure.
While light reflects off the walls and everything around us, that is how the human eye can see. Her eyes can not comprehend reflections or complex patterns of light.
This also means entities that aren't composed of light at all, such as spirits and ghosts, cannot be detected properly. Even if they existed, she could not perceive them.
Even a simple puddle on the ground can be a cause for concern.Luna mainly designed several Luna has developed several backpacks, all of which are used to help her go about daily activities when I can not assist her.
Backpacks -1 - A backpack which expands into a table with various different devices and equipment, all for analysing and modifying electronics.2 - A backpack with an extra set of 2 or 4 arms, all used for helping reach higher shelves or lugging around heavy equipment.3 - A backpack with an exoskeleton suit, used when she runs out on expeditions with Yuki and the others.4 - A backpack containing a portable computer with similar processing power as her mega computer at home. She uses this when she is travelling around with the intent to stay at a different residence for a few days or more.5 - The last backpack is her WIP. Utilising a power she gained from researching the virtual game characters, she created her own version of a backpack using the same traits which can be altered by Yuki. Allowing it to be modified to suit whatever is needed. It's still super unstable and can resort in a lot of explosions but who doesn't like that?Title
