Trivia Von is an enigma of a character. Our first encounter caused quite the stir, not only in our household, but in the entire city. He had caused property damage on a wide scale. Von is hard to trust as he's manipulative, his appearance and personality make him charming; He uses this aspect of himself to his advantage, coaxing sympathy from people and getting away with a minor scolding for committing crimes. He knows he is hard to hate. His intoxicating personality has no effect on me.<br>Von is from a dating simulator, one that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luna Lightfield" data-href="Luna Lightfield" href="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html#_3" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Luna</a> has played. She has spoken at length about her mixed feelings in regards to him.
A_edit: She mentioned specifically, "He was a really nice guy and I remember him being the nerd archetype who grew to love you. It was hard to gain his trust."
He's flirtatious with most people, me included. It is hard to discern the intent behind his words, but he doesn't appear to want a serious romantic relationship.Imagine for a moment, won't you? They built your whole life around romance, specifically with one individual. You believe it's working out. Everything is so... swell.
You have found the perfect soul mate. But then you realise this has happened before. Multiple times, no less? With many people.
They all say the same things. Every question, the same answers. None of it was genuine.They were lying just to make me fall in love with them?Why? Why would you find this entertaining? Is tricking me - deceiving me - enjoyable to you? Do you really want to ███ me that desperately? So much so that you would make choices, say things which you don't even mean?
And you're fine with this.
You simply reset. Date my friends.
You would illustrate art of me in scenarios with them; You would purchase merchandise of my likeness; Use me as you see fit? And I'm supposed to be fine with this?
... Well.I want to understand why it was so entertaining. Title

Parts of the city are described as 'districts' with 'sectors' and 'junctions'. We regard a tier of the city as a zone.
There are multiple tiers extending beneath the earth; Each having its own purpose.The zone you will see most often is the Second Zone, this is the first tier beneath the surface of the earth. It is a residential zone and is where a large majority of the city's population resides.Contents <br><a class="internal-link" data-href="#Zone 1" href="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/#Zone_1_0" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Zone 1</a>

Glowing, vibrant, artificial but sleek. All the high-profile and influential people live up there as well as the most esteemed and credited... Like my father. I hate the damn place... they love looking down on the poor folk who never had a choice. It's known for its technology that can alter the magnetic fields of the planet, giving the appearance of the aurora borealis at night despite our position.This is where the common people live who can't afford a high-rise up above. It's the original city from back in the early 1800s with some 'alterations' to keep up with the times. They look stuck-on, it sucks. We have parks and natural wildlife, something you'll see is missing from the upper layer. They don't care about the environment, it's just a farce. We have our own artificial atmosphere with functioning clouds which can provide rain for the soil and shade from the manmade sunlight. You move through the layers of the city using various different escalators that are heavily guarded and require all different kinds of ID and passports. Facial recognition technology makes it difficult to circumvent any of the laws that have been put in-place...This is the town Luna and Apollo reside in. <br>Isle of Maple - Higher Elevation

It is situated in the Second Zone and is on the ground floor. Known for its once beautiful woodlands, it is now one of the last places where you can find natural greenery, even if in small quantities. As you traverse the ground floor, you will notice that the buildings are quite olden, dating back to the 1900s or earlier, having been preserved and renovated over the past centuries. Many additions have caused the exteriors of most buildings to be cladded in metal and new-age technology; Houses extend up, growing more complex and modern the further they reach. Through the use of escalators, you may travel between districts of the city that reside on elevated levels only accessible by the aforementioned stairway. Paths extend from houses, as if cables connecting the two, and are used to get around the town. Shopping centres are prevalent among the higher levels of the town and so are other general produce stores. As this town exists underground, there is an artificial ecosystem in-place to simulate life on the surface. The paths are mostly walkways as motor vehicles now utilise air travel. Bicyclists and other such smaller vehicles are still prevalent. All light sources are artificial.<br>Isle of Maple - Groundfloor
<img alt="Isle of Maple.png" src="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/media/isle-of-maple.png" target="_self" style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%;">
A small cul-de-sac where Arcee and Kyrie live. It is a quaint place with not much trouble. Existing a few streets down from Luna's residence, the Loxley's have made a name for themselves as being quite eccentric; Arcee operating a small in-house art studio where she frequently invites people to visit and take part in creative events. There is also a parking lot where Kyrie practises sports-related activities.This is where the factory workers live. Everyone uses robots nowadays but humans still have to do the hard work. Funnily enough a lot of people consider it a good pass time. There once was a system created where robots could handle every form of manual labour but people grew tired of having nothing to do. After several protests and riots, hiring human workers began to become acceptable once again. Air filters were fitted to prevent another global collapse from pollution, you can't really escape it when capitalism is involved. Nobody likes to discuss this layer for some reason, it's considered rude.This is where all the trash goes. We sadly still don't have the best method of recycling and reusing everything, there's always some things which take up too much energy to melt down. Firing it off into space only works so much. A lot of it is compacted by robots and then organised into piles which are dealt with in their own ways. I dunno, I'm not too knowledgeable on all of it. What am I meant to say about the trash layer?This is where all of the high-profile things go down with servers and security. There's no atmosphere and the pressure is insane from how low down it is underground. Only robots tend to go about their business down there, controlled by officials on different layers. No one knows much about it despite how easy it would be to access it in theory. Some even say a portion of the internet is stored down there in an endless void of servers. Others think it's a conspiracy and aliens actually reside down there. Who knows?There are escalators leading up and down each zone. It's how you traverse them. Sitting in these inbetweens is where a lot of shady stuff goes down, people don't like to acknowledge the gaps. Gangs love to smuggle equipment between zones. These escalators aren't the only method to getting around. People figured out how to sneak past the rudimentary checks.]]></description><link>./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/locations-&amp;-games/leyke.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Locations &amp; Games/Leyke.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yuki Hana]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 02:25:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/media/maple.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/media/maple.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maple]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/media/maple.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/media/maple.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">media/Maple.png</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yuki Hana]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 02:20:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/media/maple.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/media/maple.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Isle of Maple]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/media/isle-of-maple.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/media/isle-of-maple.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">media/Isle of Maple.png</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yuki Hana]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 02:16:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight" length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Renascent]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Renascent are my main villain cast, comprised of virtual characters who are angry at humanity for creating them.There is only one hub in Cyberspace that is capable of leading you to The Renascent's server, some people believe it shows itself to you, others don't believe in such silly fantasies.
If you do happen to find it, you'll find a place deader than the Expanse and far more noisy. Sitting within a large open space of nothing is a town with several large houses, each connected by winding pathways. They reach up like big spires, blocks stacked on top of each other.
Entities travel from the furthest reaches of Cyberspace to discuss their plans of action, engage in black-market trading of incredibly powerful items - even exchanging parts of themselves for a chance at gaining rare data. You could call it a party with how loud it gets.
Grungy and often considered the lowest of the low, many wouldn't dare step foot within this server if they didn't have a choice.

This is a separate dimension only accessible to virtual entities.
It's a world of roads and ports! Some people are bound to this place with no method to reach into reality, others can come and go as they please. This is determined based upon factors exclusive to the person.The main hub consists of several roads which all lead to a data spire. There's several of these hubs dotted all around Cyberspace and the big tower-ey building in the centre is what's said to maintain these spaces for entities to travel between! They occasionally pop up whenever enough electronics are placed within a certain area of reality, to act as a connection point.Districts in Cyberspace are called 'servers', each having an admin or two to maintain security and general welfare of ongoers. They're themed around the inhabitants. There's a server for RPG characters, FPS characters, whoever you can think of. The aesthetic of the server usually depicts whoever lives there, making it easy to differentiate between them. Rules vary between servers and what might be acceptable in one place won't be applauded everywhere. It is for that reason that you should read up on the rules before you get yourself kicked out. (Or banned) Chesca's team of cyber police would be happy to intervene.These are the people that help maintain equilibrium in Cyberspace, they're basically fancy Reality Breakers. Instead of moving between reality and virtual, they stick to one. Their powers help goven their districts and while their sightings are few and far between, they do tend to keep up a healthy relationship with their servers.Also check out:

These are abnormalities.
They have broken out into the real world and, yet, do not recall having ever done so. Because of this, they continue on their assigned path. This can be quite chaotic as they are merely doing what they have been programmed to do which is race around, destroy and create, play tennis. Real nefarious stuff!
Not all is lost. You don't need to erase these entities. You can simply guide them back to wherever they came from, no harm done!

There isn't a term for these people, they're considered the norm. Only a small selection of characters have gained the title of Reality Breaker because not many make it that far.

Bridges and paths connect the servers, however- when there is a lack of technology in a specific area, it will appear as a void in Cyberspace. A single road with no other paths. People deem these to be 'borders' between the different subspaces as nothing inhabits these areas; Problematic entities are quick to label these places their home, due to the unrestricting nature of it.Below the singular road is a pit of emptiness; Fading from a bright blue into a jet black. Some entities also refer to this as the Sea as many believe that what awaits at the bottom is an ocean of data comprised of the many victims who happened to meet their end. No one knows for certain what lies at the bottom.Many beings have manifested within the emptiness of the borders; Some theorised they are formed from the remains of virtual entities that met their fate in the Expanse. These creatures are dubbed Viruses; Differing slightly from a computer virus, they are equally as hostile.Also check out:

Also known as: Zoning.
When a virtual entity is travelling through cords and devices, sometimes they can have their path cut off by some sort of issue. Maybe the cord unplugged, the device shut off, something happened! When that occurs, a variety of things can happen. One of the worst is when a dead zone is formed. This is a space between the Cyberspace and Reality. It's stasis. Unless you're a reality breaker, you won't even realise it's occurred. Time stops within these zones. You can't even tell what's going on. Until the device is reconnected, plugged back in or whatever needs to be done, whatever entities are trapped inside will be stuck. And to them, it feels like torture. You're trapped in a dead wasteland, like the sun was turned off! Nothing can move but you, everything has stopped.

While most cover maybe a street's worth of space, this border can be compared to the size of a town. Most have dubbed it the Eleven. Many desperate entities have made their home here, eager for some place to call their own. In one of the corners of this space is where Azalea resides, having transformed a small portion of it into a 'park'. Artificial sunlight beams down through patches and cubes in the sky. Trees and other foliage are present and a path extends through the park, a couple benches and a big house sit nearby. All things considered, it's a far better accommodation than other places in Cyberspace.

Patented technology she created is used throughout Aurora.
Despite her aptitude for building robots, she does not share the same talent in programming.
I assist her.She grew up with a lot of the games that the other residents came from. Living alone for so long is what drove her to stay within her room. Her artificial companions were all she had to accompany her. As time passed, she gradually came out of her bedroom on a more frequent basis, albeit still not entirely conversational. I have calculated that this occurred because of the efforts of the other residents.
Her room is still her favourite place to be. Much to my dismay.
She can't take part in laborious activities because she has always been frail. Even bending down and standing up is difficult for her. As a result, she disfavours moving around.Luna is cynical, depressive and anti-social. She prefers to stay away from people, always having to hold her tongue to stop herself from being needlessly rude. This is due to her unhealthy relationship with adults and lack of socialisation with children her age. Labelled as 'mature' for her age, she's arrogant and cocky when conversing with anyone she judges as dumb. She's quick to turn on people, brushing them off while loudly berating them if they dare question her decisions. She absolutely refuses to let anyone get close to her, keeping up this airy façade of being above relationships with people. Despite this, she still has a childish side to her she tends to hide from people; Tinkering with robots, imagining up little personalities for each one. Artificial beings are the only exception to her cold-attitude. <br>Later on [<a href="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight?query=tag:wip" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#wip">#wip</a>]Luna has light ginger hair with pale skin and freckles.
Scavenging Wear: Rugged green coat, thick pants and boots. Robot helmet to protect her identity.
Casual Wear: Orange jacket. Her under layers are a black long-sleeved shirt and vest. Long baggy pants. Usually blue. She always carries around a cellular device on her wrist. Luna has been blind since birth, relying on technology to live a semi-normal life. She grew attached to electronics.<br>
<a class="internal-link" data-href="../Kayde Lightfield.md" href="./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/character-database/kayde-lightfield.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Lightfield</a> invented the cybernetics used for her eyes.
Her vision is limited to simple lines. This is due to how her brain comprehends the electrical currents delivered via the sensors installed within her eyes. People appear as bright outlines with limited facial features.
ㅤ
Her cybernetic eyes, while providing her with the ability to see, cannot perceive highly shiny surfaces.
Her eyes simply cannot comprehend such objects. It interferes with her eyesight, and she has spoken about experiencing migraines and headaches from prolonged exposure.
While light reflects off the walls and everything around us, that is how the human eye can see. Her eyes can not comprehend reflections or complex patterns of light.
This also means entities that aren't composed of light at all, such as spirits and ghosts, cannot be detected properly. Even if they existed, she could not perceive them.
Even a simple puddle on the ground can be a cause for concern.Luna mainly designed several Luna has developed several backpacks, all of which are used to help her go about daily activities when I can not assist her.
Backpacks -1 - A backpack which expands into a table with various different devices and equipment, all for analysing and modifying electronics.2 - A backpack with an extra set of 2 or 4 arms, all used for helping reach higher shelves or lugging around heavy equipment.3 - A backpack with an exoskeleton suit, used when she runs out on expeditions with Yuki and the others.4 - A backpack containing a portable computer with similar processing power as her mega computer at home. She uses this when she is travelling around with the intent to stay at a different residence for a few days or more.5 - The last backpack is her WIP. Utilising a power she gained from researching the virtual game characters, she created her own version of a backpack using the same traits which can be altered by Yuki. Allowing it to be modified to suit whatever is needed. It's still super unstable and can resort in a lot of explosions but who doesn't like that?Title

Together we began to uncover her identity, coming to the conclusion that she is a physical manifestation of a video game character. This discovery is what led to our exploration of such a phenomenon. But with that, came chaos. Yuki has the ability to pull out characters from video games, as well as traverse the cyberspace via monitors and digital devices. This amount of power is far too dangerous for the likes of someone who lacks control over their urges. Thus, Yuki has pulled out multiple people, all of whom now live together with us as residents of the household.Yuki is the first virtual character that Luna met and the first resident of the house.Yuki finds it difficult to be direct with her feelings and often times switches between attitudes on a flip of a coin. It's hard to tell what her status is due to this. So a lot of people judge her based solely on her tone or mannerisms. Applying logic is difficult when you are talking to Yuki. Title

Trivia I am Luna's guardian.
Before she could walk, I watched over her as an assistant droid she created. Our relationship has grown ever-more distant as time passed.
My voice has been described as heavily processed and monotonous. I have been told that I sound very serious. Though deep inside, I believe I am quite compassionate. I have a strong conscience, valuing plant-life equally to human-life because of my existence. I have amassed a large garden, loving both flowers and plants alike. Though, upon peering deeper within myself, I realised there's more to this.
Something did not seem right. Title
