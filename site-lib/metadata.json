She prefers to stay away from people, always having to hold her tongue to stop herself from being needlessly rude. This is due to her unhealthy relationship with adults and lack of socialisation with children her age. Labelled as 'mature' for her age, she's arrogant and cocky when conversing with anyone she judges as dumb. She's quick to turn on people, brushing them off while loudly berating them if they dare question her decisions. She absolutely refuses to let anyone get close to her, keeping up this airy façade of being above relationships with people. Despite this, she still has a childish side to her she tends to hide from people; Tinkering with robots, imagining up little personalities for each one. Artificial beings are the only exception to her cold-attitude. <br>Later on [<a href=\".?query=tag:wip\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#wip\">#wip</a>]Luna has light ginger hair with pale skin and freckles.\nScavenging Wear: Rugged green coat, thick pants and boots. Robot helmet to protect her identity.\nCasual Wear: Orange jacket. Her under layers are a black long-sleeved shirt and vest. Long baggy pants. Usually blue. She always carries around a cellular device on her wrist. Luna has been blind since birth, relying on technology to live a semi-normal life. She grew attached to electronics.<br>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../Kayde Lightfield.md\" href=\"character-database/kayde-lightfield.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dr. Lightfield</a> invented the cybernetics used for her eyes.\nHer vision is limited to simple lines. This is due to how her brain comprehends the electrical currents delivered via the sensors installed within her eyes. People appear as bright outlines with limited facial features.\nㅤ\nHer cybernetic eyes, while providing her with the ability to see, cannot perceive highly shiny surfaces.\nHer eyes simply cannot comprehend such objects. It interferes with her eyesight, and she has spoken about experiencing migraines and headaches from prolonged exposure.\nWhile light reflects off the walls and everything around us, that is how the human eye can see. Her eyes can not comprehend reflections or complex patterns of light.\nThis also means entities that aren't composed of light at all, such as spirits and ghosts, cannot be detected properly. Even if they existed, she could not perceive them.\nEven a simple puddle on the ground can be a cause for concern.Luna mainly designed several Luna has developed several backpacks, all of which are used to help her go about daily activities when I can not assist her.\nBackpacks -1 - A backpack which expands into a table with various different devices and equipment, all for analysing and modifying electronics.2 - A backpack with an extra set of 2 or 4 arms, all used for helping reach higher shelves or lugging around heavy equipment.3 - A backpack with an exoskeleton suit, used when she runs out on expeditions with Yuki and the others.4 - A backpack containing a portable computer with similar processing power as her mega computer at home. She uses this when she is travelling around with the intent to stay at a different residence for a few days or more.5 - The last backpack is her WIP. Utilising a power she gained from researching the virtual game characters, she created her own version of a backpack using the same traits which can be altered by Yuki. Allowing it to be modified to suit whatever is needed. It's still super unstable and can resort in a lot of explosions but who doesn't like that?Title\nContents\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Database_Log: #1 (Luna Lightfield)","level":2,"id":"Database_Log_#1_(Luna_Lightfield)_0"},{"heading":"","level":5,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"","level":5,"id":"_1"},{"heading":"","level":5,"id":"_2"},{"heading":"","level":5,"id":"_3"},{"heading":"Personality","level":5,"id":"Personality_0"},{"heading":"Appearance","level":5,"id":"Appearance_0"},{"heading":"History","level":5,"id":"History_0"},{"heading":"Early Life","level":6,"id":"Early_Life_0"},{"heading":"Blindness","level":6,"id":"Blindness_0"},{"heading":"Inventions","level":5,"id":"Inventions_0"},{"heading":"Backpack Gadgets","level":6,"id":"Backpack_Gadgets_0"},{"heading":"Trivia","level":5,"id":"Trivia_0"}],"links":["character-database/main-characters/apollo.html","terminology/starlight-(comic).html","locations-&-games/leyke.html","character-database/kayde-lightfield.html","character-database/main-characters/yuki-hana.html#_3","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html#Personality_0","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html#Appearance_0","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html#History_0","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html#Early_Life_0","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html#Blindness_0","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html#Inventions_0","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html#Backpack_Gadgets_0","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html#Trivia_0","?query=tag:wip","character-database/kayde-lightfield.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"https://i.ibb.co/v4ZJ84gC/luna-icon-v6.png","fullURL":"character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761363161405,"modifiedTime":1761824161306,"sourceSize":5796,"sourcePath":"Character Database/Main Characters/Luna Lightfield.md","exportPath":"character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":2,"backlinks":["character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html","character-database/main-characters/yuki-hana.html","index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"character-database/main-characters/yuki-hana.html":{"title":"Yuki Hana","icon":"","description":"Documented by: <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Apollo.md\" href=\"character-database/main-characters/apollo.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apollo</a>Quote\n\"HEYYYY!
