Patented technology she created is used throughout Aurora.\nDespite her aptitude for building robots, she does not share the same talent in programming.\nI assist her.She grew up with a lot of the games that the other residents came from. Living alone for so long is what drove her to stay within her room. Her artificial companions were all she had to accompany her. As time passed, she gradually came out of her bedroom on a more frequent basis, albeit still not entirely conversational. I have calculated that this occurred because of the efforts of the other residents.\nHer room is still her favourite place to be. Much to my dismay.\nShe can't take part in laborious activities because she has always been frail. Even bending down and standing up is difficult for her. As a result, she disfavours moving around.Luna is cynical, depressive and anti-social. She prefers to stay away from people, always having to hold her tongue to stop herself from being needlessly rude. This is due to her unhealthy relationship with adults and lack of socialisation with children her age. Labelled as 'mature' for her age, she's arrogant and cocky when conversing with anyone she judges as dumb. She's quick to turn on people, brushing them off while loudly berating them if they dare question her decisions. She absolutely refuses to let anyone get close to her, keeping up this airy façade of being above relationships with people. Despite this, she still has a childish side to her she tends to hide from people; Tinkering with robots, imagining up little personalities for each one. Artificial beings are the only exception to her cold-attitude. <br>Later on [<a href=\"./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight?query=tag:wip\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#wip\">#wip</a>]Luna has light ginger hair with pale skin and freckles.\nScavenging Wear: Rugged green coat, thick pants and boots. Robot helmet to protect her identity.\nCasual Wear: Orange jacket. Her under layers are a black long-sleeved shirt and vest. Long baggy pants. Usually blue. She always carries around a cellular device on her wrist. Luna has been blind since birth, relying on technology to live a semi-normal life. She grew attached to electronics.<br>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../Kayde Lightfield.md\" href=\"./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/character-database/kayde-lightfield.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dr. Lightfield</a> invented the cybernetics used for her eyes.\nHer vision is limited to simple lines. This is due to how her brain comprehends the electrical currents delivered via the sensors installed within her eyes. People appear as bright outlines with limited facial features.\nㅤ\nHer cybernetic eyes, while providing her with the ability to see, cannot perceive highly shiny surfaces.\nHer eyes simply cannot comprehend such objects. It interferes with her eyesight, and she has spoken about experiencing migraines and headaches from prolonged exposure.\nWhile light reflects off the walls and everything around us, that is how the human eye can see. Her eyes can not comprehend reflections or complex patterns of light.\nThis also means entities that aren't composed of light at all, such as spirits and ghosts, cannot be detected properly. Even if they existed, she could not perceive them.\nEven a simple puddle on the ground can be a cause for concern.Luna mainly designed several Luna has developed several backpacks, all of which are used to help her go about daily activities when I can not assist her.\nBackpacks -1 - A backpack which expands into a table with various different devices and equipment, all for analysing and modifying electronics.2 - A backpack with an extra set of 2 or 4 arms, all used for helping reach higher shelves or lugging around heavy equipment.3 - A backpack with an exoskeleton suit, used when she runs out on expeditions with Yuki and the others.4 - A backpack containing a portable computer with similar processing power as her mega computer at home. She uses this when she is travelling around with the intent to stay at a different residence for a few days or more.5 - The last backpack is her WIP. Utilising a power she gained from researching the virtual game characters, she created her own version of a backpack using the same traits which can be altered by Yuki. Allowing it to be modified to suit whatever is needed. It's still super unstable and can resort in a lot of explosions but who doesn't like that?Title\nContents\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Database_Log: #1 (Luna Lightfield)","level":2,"id":"Database_Log_#1_(Luna_Lightfield)_0"},{"heading":"","level":5,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"","level":5,"id":"_1"},{"heading":"","level":5,"id":"_2"},{"heading":"","level":5,"id":"_3"},{"heading":"Personality","level":5,"id":"Personality_0"},{"heading":"Appearance","level":5,"id":"Appearance_0"},{"heading":"History","level":5,"id":"History_0"},{"heading":"Early Life","level":6,"id":"Early_Life_0"},{"heading":"Blindness","level":6,"id":"Blindness_0"},{"heading":"Inventions","level":5,"id":"Inventions_0"},{"heading":"Backpack Gadgets","level":6,"id":"Backpack_Gadgets_0"},{"heading":"Trivia","level":5,"id":"Trivia_0"}],"links":["character-database/main-characters/apollo.html#_3","terminology/starlight-(comic).html","locations-&-games/leyke.html#_3","character-database/kayde-lightfield.html","character-database/main-characters/yuki-hana.html#_3","?query=tag:wip","character-database/kayde-lightfield.html"],"author":"Yuki Hana","coverImageURL":"https://i.ibb.co/v4ZJ84gC/luna-icon-v6.png","fullURL":"./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761363161405,"modifiedTime":1761960070642,"sourceSize":6661,"sourcePath":"Character Database/Main Characters/Luna Lightfield.md","exportPath":"character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":4,"backlinks":["character-database/characters.html","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html","character-database/main-characters/von.html","index.html","locations-&-games/leyke.html"],"type":"markdown"},"character-database/main-characters/shirayuki.html":{"title":"Shirayuki","icon":"","description":"Documented by: <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Apollo.md\" href=\"./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/character-database/main-characters/apollo.html#_3\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apollo</a>Quote\n\"Lol. ur like,\nlooking at this?\nK.

Together we began to uncover her identity, coming to the conclusion that she is a physical manifestation of a video game character. This discovery is what led to our exploration of such a phenomenon. But with that, came chaos. Yuki has the ability to pull out characters from video games, as well as traverse the cyberspace via monitors and digital devices. This amount of power is far too dangerous for the likes of someone who lacks control over their urges. Thus, Yuki has pulled out multiple people, all of whom now live together with us as residents of the household.Yuki is the first virtual character that Luna met and the first resident of the house.Yuki finds it difficult to be direct with her feelings and often times switches between attitudes on a flip of a coin. It's hard to tell what her status is due to this. So a lot of people judge her based solely on her tone or mannerisms. Applying logic is difficult when you are talking to Yuki.

Parts of the city are described as 'districts' with 'sectors' and 'junctions'. We regard a tier of the city as a zone.\nThere are multiple tiers extending beneath the earth; Each having its own purpose.The zone you will see most often is the Second Zone, this is the first tier beneath the surface of the earth.

Glowing, vibrant, artificial but sleek. All the high-profile and influential people live up there as well as the most esteemed and credited... Like my father. I hate the damn place... they love looking down on the poor folk who never had a choice. It's known for its technology that can alter the magnetic fields of the planet, giving the appearance of the aurora borealis at night despite our position.This is where the common people live who can't afford a high-rise up above. It's the original city from back in the early 1800s with some 'alterations' to keep up with the times. They look stuck-on, it sucks. We have parks and natural wildlife, something you'll see is missing from the upper layer. They don't care about the environment, it's just a farce. We have our own artificial atmosphere with functioning clouds which can provide rain for the soil and shade from the manmade sunlight. You move through the layers of the city using various different escalators that are heavily guarded and require all different kinds of ID and passports. Facial recognition technology makes it difficult to circumvent any of the laws that have been put in-place...This is the town Luna and Apollo reside in. <br>Isle of Maple - Higher Elevation\n<img alt=\"Maple.png\" src=\"./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/_media/maple.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 250px; max-width: 100%;\">\nIt is situated in the Second Zone and is on the ground floor. Known for its once beautiful woodlands, it is now one of the last places where you can find natural greenery, even if in small quantities. As you traverse the ground floor, you will notice that the buildings are quite olden, dating back to the 1900s or earlier, having been preserved and renovated over the past centuries. Many additions have caused the exteriors of most buildings to be cladded in metal and new-age technology; Houses extend up, growing more complex and modern the further they reach. Through the use of escalators, you may travel between districts of the city that reside on elevated levels only accessible by the aforementioned stairway. Paths extend from houses, as if cables connecting the two, and are used to get around the town. Shopping centres are prevalent among the higher levels of the town and so are other general produce stores. As this town exists underground, there is an artificial ecosystem in-place to simulate life on the surface. The paths are mostly walkways as motor vehicles now utilise air travel. Bicyclists and other such smaller vehicles are still prevalent. All light sources are artificial.<br>Isle of Maple - Groundfloor\n<img alt=\"Isle of Maple.png\" src=\"./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/_media/isle-of-maple.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 250px; max-width: 100%;\">\nA small cul-de-sac where Arcee and Kyrie live. It is a quaint place with not much trouble. Existing a few streets down from Luna's residence, the Loxley's have made a name for themselves as being quite eccentric; Arcee operating a small in-house art studio where she frequently invites people to visit and take part in creative events. There is also a parking lot where Kyrie practises sports-related activities.This is where the factory workers live. Everyone uses robots nowadays but humans still have to do the hard work. Funnily enough a lot of people consider it a good pass time. There once was a system created where robots could handle every form of manual labour but people grew tired of having nothing to do. After several protests and riots, hiring human workers began to become acceptable once again. Air filters were fitted to prevent another global collapse from pollution, you can't really escape it when capitalism is involved. Nobody likes to discuss this layer for some reason, it's considered rude.This is where all the trash goes. We sadly still don't have the best method of recycling and reusing everything, there's always some things which take up too much energy to melt down. Firing it off into space only works so much. A lot of it is compacted by robots and then organised into piles which are dealt with in their own ways. I dunno, I'm not too knowledgeable on all of it. What am I meant to say about the trash layer?This is where all of the high-profile things go down with servers and security. There's no atmosphere and the pressure is insane from how low down it is underground. Only robots tend to go about their business down there, controlled by officials on different layers. No one knows much about it despite how easy it would be to access it in theory. Some even say a portion of the internet is stored down there in an endless void of servers. Others think it's a conspiracy and aliens actually reside down there. Who knows?There are escalators leading up and down each zone. It's how you traverse them. Sitting in these inbetweens is where a lot of shady stuff goes down, people don't like to acknowledge the gaps. Gangs love to smuggle equipment between zones. These escalators aren't the only method to getting around. People figured out how to sneak past the rudimentary checks.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Zone 1","level":4,"id":"Zone_1_0"},{"heading":"Zone 2","level":4,"id":"Zone_2_0"},{"heading":"Isle of Maple","level":5,"id":"Isle_of_Maple_0"},{"heading":"Rynlei Street","level":6,"id":"Rynlei_Street_0"},{"heading":"Zone 3","level":4,"id":"Zone_3_0"},{"heading":"Zone 4","level":4,"id":"Zone_4_0"},{"heading":"Zone 5","level":4,"id":"Zone_5_0"},{"heading":"The Gaps (name wip)","level":4,"id":"The_Gaps_(name_wip)_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:Aurora","?query=tag:Lightfield","character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html"],"author":"Yuki Hana","coverImageURL":"./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/_media/maple.png","fullURL":"./https://kanarii.github.io/starlight/locations-&-games/leyke.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["_media/maple.png","_media/isle-of-maple.png"],"createdTime":1761443848743,"modifiedTime":1761963902693,"sourceSize":6322,"sourcePath":"Locations & Games/Leyke.md","exportPath":"locations-&-games/leyke.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":10,"backlinks":["character-database/main-characters/luna-lightfield.html","locations-&-games/leyke.html","terminology/terminology.html"],"type":"markdown"},"terminology/cyberspace.html":{"title":"Cyberspace","icon":"","description":"The world within technology!

There's several of these hubs dotted all around Cyberspace and the big tower-ey building in the centre is what's said to maintain these spaces for entities to travel between! They occasionally pop up whenever enough electronics are placed within a certain area of reality, to act as a connection point.Districts in Cyberspace are called 'servers', each having an admin or two to maintain security and general welfare of ongoers. They're themed around the inhabitants. There's a server for RPG characters, FPS characters, whoever you can think of. The aesthetic of the server usually depicts whoever lives there, making it easy to differentiate between them. Rules vary between servers and what might be acceptable in one place won't be applauded everywhere. It is for that reason that you should read up on the rules before you get yourself kicked out. (Or banned) Chesca's team of cyber police would be happy to intervene.These are the people that help maintain equilibrium in Cyberspace, they're basically fancy Reality Breakers.

In one of the corners of this space is where Azalea resides, having transformed a small portion of it into a 'park'. Artificial sunlight beams down through patches and cubes in the sky. Trees and other foliage are present and a path extends through the park, a couple benches and a big house sit nearby.

There isn't a term for these people, they're considered the norm. Only a small selection of characters have gained the title of Reality Breaker because not many make it that far. Yuki, Von as well as Arc are a part of this group, as they have either questioned or are questioning their existence.
